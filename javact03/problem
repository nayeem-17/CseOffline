Instructions
Consider the following class:

class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;

    Product (String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }  
    public double getPrice() {
        return this.price;
    }
}

Write Java code for the following:
        
        Define an ArrayList named myProducts that can store a list of Product       

        Generate 5 random Product with names 'A' to 'E' and random 
        price and add them to myProducts             

        Add a new Product with name ‘PDummy’ and price 1000 at index 1 of myProducts                

        Sort myProducts based on Product’s price in ascending order. 
        You can't use your own sorting techniques.
        You can change the Product class if necessary                           
        
        Print all the Product objects of myProducts
